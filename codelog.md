# System Reporter CLI Code Log

## Day 1

### Log

Today I initialised the project and had it output basic information about the user and system. I am using the following articles as reference/inspiration:

### Issues

The only issue I have come across so far is the package returns an error when I try to run it as a cli:
`` /usr/local/bin/system-reporter: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `(' /usr/local/bin/system-reporter: line 1: `const { username, osCode, osVersion } = require('./lib/os');' ``
