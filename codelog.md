# System Reporter CLI Code Log

## Day 1

### Log

Today I initialised the project and had it output basic information about the user and system. I am using the following articles as reference/inspiration:

- https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-to-build-a-command-line-cli-tool-in-nodejs-b8072b291f81
- https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/06/18/command-line-app-with-nodejs
- https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-command-line-interface-cli-node-js/

I also added some useful libraries for creating Command Line Tools and added information about the processors, memory and more in depth system information.

### Issues

The only issue I have come across so far is the package returns an error when I try to run it as a cli:  
`` /usr/local/bin/system-reporter: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `(' ``  
`` /usr/local/bin/system-reporter: line 1: `const { username, osCode, osVersion } = require('./lib/os');'  ``

This was solved by adding a "shebang" line at the top of the entrypoint file. This line, which starts with '#!', lets the unix system know to parse this file as an interpreter directive.

## Day 2

Today I implemented the use of writing a config file to save a user's name so they can be addressed personally, a bit of functionality that would have blown my mind as a 7 year old in 1995 ðŸ¤“.

### Issues

One issue I came across today was the `fs.readFile()` method not working which was puzzling initially, but I quickly found out it is an asynchronous function and I was using it synchronosly. To use it properly it should be used with async-await (or a Promise), or alternatively (if the file is small), fs.readFileSync() can be used.

Other similar issues popped up, all revolving around my poor level of understanding in how asynchronos functions work, and in particular what order to expect awaited vs non-awaited functions to be called.
